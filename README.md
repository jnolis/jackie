# Jackie - a Hugo theme with Bootstrap

This theme is a modification of the [Blank theme by Vimux](https://github.com/Vimux/blank) that I use on my [personal website](https://jnolis.com). I wrote a [blog post](https://jnolis.com/blog/hugo_for_fussy_people/) on how you can make your own theme like this.

## Installation

In your Hugo site `themes` directory, run:

```
git clone https://github.com/jnolis/jackie
```

Then go to your `config.toml` in the base of the Hugo site and ensure the theme option is set to `jackie`.

## License

This theme is released under the [MIT license](https://github.com/Vimux/blank/blob/master/LICENSE).
